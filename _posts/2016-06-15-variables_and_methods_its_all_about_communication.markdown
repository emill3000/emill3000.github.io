title:  "Variables and Methods: It's All About Communication"

I've been thinking a lot about communication lately. Why? Because I'm terrible at it... but I'm trying to learn. I'm going to work on my methods, you see. If you want to be a good communicator you have to be able to create clear and precise methods. Otherwise, your variables will just get confused. They'll do crazy things that are certainly not what you thought you were asking them to do, or they'll just do nothing at all. So, think it through and even write it out if you have to. What, precisely, do I want my variable to do in this situation? How do I tell it WHEN to do it? How do I tell it HOW to do it? And, don't forget, how do I tell it WHEN TO STOP doing it? Thankfully, we have error messages. So, you thought you were telling your variable to go do it's thing and have fun, that you appreciated it's need for "me time", that you too need "me time." But, for some reason, your variable just left and maybe didn't text you when it got home, like you thought it would, and now it seems to be spending a lot of time with another coder? Well, read your error messages, take heed, and try again! Too bad we don't have error messages for life, huh?
