I'm exhausted. I've surrounded myself with loud, angry, stinky, sometimes violent, often terrified, ailing creatures for the last 15 years and I'm done. Compassion fatigue, burn out, depression are all hot topics in veterinary medicine these days. According to several recent studies the suicide rate among veterinary professionals is 4 times that of the general public. There are plenty of reasons veterinarians and their support staff are such a mess but that's a conversation for another day. The problem is, I can't see a way to fix it; not anytime soon, at least.

So, I'm giving up and moving on. But why software development? I'll be honest, initially, my goal was just to find a career I could learn while working full-time, earn enough money to retire before I die, and not feel the need to pour my entire being into. I'd also love to be able to work remotely so I can go places and do stuff for a change. Computers, of course! There are ample online programs to learn development so I wouldn't have to give up my current job and benefits while preparing for my next career. And money? Man, it looks like I could be making double my current salary within a few years. And, best of all? Computers aren't going to destroy my soul (hopefully.) Computers don't bite or scratch or poop! They don't feel pain. They won't make me feel guilty for poking them with needles or shoving awful medicine down their throats, (they don't even have throats!!) They won't force me to work 18 hour days non-stop because there are just not enough computer nurses to take care of all the sick and dying computers (that won't happen, right?) Computers don't have "parents" that will tell me that I'm a terrible person for murdering all the computers that can't afford to be fixed! 


So, I started taking some free online courses to see what this whole computer business is about. And something strange started happening. I found the part of my brain I loved to use again. I love to solve problems. I love to figure out how things work and make them work better! And I'm pretty good at it!
